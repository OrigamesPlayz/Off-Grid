# Off-Grid
A game where you used to be a lonely cube only allowed on the grid until you magically find a way to somehow go off-grid but i think its glitched?

## Controls

E - To interact

R - To reset to latest checkpoint

I made this game for week 10 of Hackclub Siege on the theme of Grid.
I enjoyed creating the mechanics for the game such as the fact that the player movement is relative to the rotation of the player.
Creating this game really made me learn 2D game making since usually i create 3D games.

I created this using the Unity game engine and i used some assets for the camera effects to make a sort of bugged version of the game.
